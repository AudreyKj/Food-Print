// -if the user scans fruits or vegetables, than they are generally good for 3-5 days 
//before they start loosing their freshness so we can plan 
//to send the reminder 2 days after purchase for example 
// - if the user scans meat, or fish: they usually go bad after 1 or 2 days
// - eggs: we send the reminder a few days after

// for food that is not fresh (not veggies or meat/fish, cheese, eggs), 
//we automatially send a reminder a few days after (like 3 days after purchase)


//vegetables and fruits: reminder after 2 days
//meat, fish: reminder a few hours after purchase (3h)
//eggs & cheese: reminder after 3 days
//other: reminder after 3 days
